Release 0.97 (08/10/2018)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW FEATURES:
* Application-managed Buffer Streams
    - In addition to outputting capture results to an EGLStream, clients now
      have the ability to output capture results directly to client-allocated
      image buffers. Initial support is limited to the use of EGLImages and
      EGLSync objects, and is provided through a number of new types and
      interfaces:

      StreamType
          UUID type that defines the core type of the stream and defines which
          interfaces the stream will support. Applications that continue to use
          EGLStreams will use STREAM_TYPE_EGL (and must provide that as an
          argument to ICaptureSession::createOutputStreamSettings), while the
          new application-managed buffer streams support is provided with the
          use of STREAM_TYPE_BUFFER.

      BufferType
          UUID type that defines the type of an application-managed Buffer
          resource. In this release, the only BufferType that is supported is
          BUFFER_TYPE_EGL_IMAGE, which specifies that Buffer objects will wrap
          EGLImage resources.

      SyncType
          UUID type that defines the sync type of an application-managed Buffer
          resource. The use of sync objects is optional, but they may be used to
          optimize application pipelining by synchronizing Buffer data access
          using hardware sync primitives. This allows Buffers to be output from
          Argus before the capture is fully complete so that the application
          may program its downstream pipeline earlier, reducing CPU threads and
          latency. The only hardware SyncType supported in this release is
          SYNC_TYPE_EGL_SYNC, which specifies that Buffer objects will use
          EGLSync objects for synchronizing data access to the Buffer's image
          store. Note that SYNC_TYPE_NONE is the default SyncType, which means
          that hardware sync will not be used, and so Buffers will only be
          passed between Argus and the client once all buffer access is
          complete (ie. it will CPU wait for any data access before returning).

      IBufferOutputStreamSettings
          This is used to configure Buffer OutputStream creation, and is exposed
          by OutputStreamSettings objects created using STREAM_TYPE_BUFFER.
          This interface provides methods to set the BufferType and SyncType
          that will be used with the new stream.

      IBufferOutputStream
          This is the primary interface for application-managed buffer
          OutputStreams (STREAM_TYPE_BUFFER). It provides methods for
          configuring and creating Buffer objects, as well as the acquire and
          release and synchronization mechanisms required to pass those Buffers
          between Argus and the client application.

      BufferSettings
          Provided by IBufferOutputStream, this object is used to configure the
          creation of Buffer objects. The interfaces exposed by this object
          depends on the BufferType of the OutputStream (which is currently
          limited to BUFFER_TYPE_EGL_IMAGE and IEGLImageBufferSettings).

      IEGLImageBufferSettings
          This is used to set the EGLDisplay and EGLImage handles of the EGLImage
          that will be wrapped by the new Buffer object.

      Buffer
          Created and owned by an OutputStream, these objects wrap application-
          managed buffer resources and are used to synchronize data access to
          the buffer resources between Argus and the client application. Buffers
          are released to their stream to be used by Argus for a capture
          request, and are acquired back when the capture is complete and the
          client is ready to consume the output.

      IBuffer
          This provides the core features available for all BufferTypes,
          including the ability to associate client pointers with a Buffer using
          set/getClientData.

      IEGLImageBuffer
          Provides getters for the EGLImage resources that are being wrapped by
          a Buffer having the BUFFER_TYPE_EGL_IMAGE type.

      IEGLSync
          When the SyncType is SYNC_TYPE_EGL_SYNC, this interface provides the
          means to get or set EGLSync objects on the Buffer after acquiring the
          Buffer or before releasing it for use with another capture request,
          respectively.

      Note that the use of application-managed buffers, including all of the
      objects and interfaces above, are demonstrated by the new eglImage sample.

* Ext::DolWdrSendorMode extension
    - Adds extra functionalities for Digital Overlap (DOL) Wide Dynamic Range
      (WDR) sensor modes.

* EGLStream::IImageHeaderlessFile interface
    - Provides a means to write acquired EGLStream::Images to headerless files
      (ie. raw data dump).

CHANGES:
* StreamType parameter added to ICaptureSession:createOutputStreamSettings, and
  IStream renamed to IEGLOutputStream
    - Existing applications that use EGLStreams must use the new interface
      name and pass STREAM_TYPE_EGL to createOutputStreamSettings to be
      compatible with this release.

* All VideoStabilization capabilities were removed.
    - This feature was never fully supported, and the methods given to control
      video stabilization were likely insufficient to support a proper
      implementation in the future anyways. Thus, all video stabilization-
      related components are being removed from the core API in favor of a
      future extension (if video stabilization were to ever be added again).

* Ext::FaceDetect extension support and sample were removed.
    - NVIDIA does not offer face detection capabilities in this Argus release,
      and so the face detection sample is being removed so as to not be
      misleading to users (ie. providing a sample that does not actually work).
      Since it's possible that face detection may be added again in another
      release, the Ext::FaceDetect extension header has been left in place.

* Added optional Rotation parameter to EGLStream::NV::ImageNativeBuffer.

* Sample changes:
    - CommonOptions added to sample utils to provide a more consistent set of
      command-line parameters for all of the samples (including camera device,
      sensor mode index, preview window rectangle, etc).
    - NativeBuffer class added to utils to allocate native buffer objects that
      may be used with Buffer OutputStreams. This NativeBuffer class wraps and
      uses the NvBuffer API provided by the JetPack Multimedia APIs, and uses
      the methods that API provides to create EGLImages from the NvBuffers for
      use with Argus.

* New samples:
    eglImage - Demonstrates the use of the new application-managed buffer
               support by creating a Buffer OutputStream from a set of EGLImages
               given by the application and then making capture requests with
               those Buffers. The results are then displayed by binding the
               EGLImage to an OpenGL texture and then rendering on screen.
               EGLSyncs are also used to increase the hardware pipelining
               between Argus and OpenGL.

    cudaBayerDemosaic - Demonstrates a pipelined application that chains two
                        EGLStreams -- one between Argus and CUDA, and another
                        between CUDA and OpenGL -- in order to consume a Bayer
                        EGLStream with CUDA and (crudely) demosaic into another
                        RGBA stream which is then rendered on screen by OpenGL.

BUG FIXES:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release 0.96 (10/05/2016)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW FEATURES:
* Ext::BayerAverageMap - Provides pixel averages and clipping statistics.
* Edge enhancement controls and metadata.
* Saturation controls and metadata.
* Improved denoise controls and metadata.
* Improved white balance controls.
* Per-stream post-processing enable.

* New samples:
    userAutoExposure     - Demonstrates manual exposure time and analog gain
                           controls using a basic auto-exposure algorithm.
    userAutoWhiteBalance - Demonstrates manual white balance controls.
    denoise              - Uses two streams to render a side-by-side comparison
                           of the effect of enabling denoise algorithms.
    bayerAverageMap      - Uses the BayerAverageMap extension to visualize the
                           average color and clipping statistics.

CHANGES:
* The multiprocess implementation is now used by default.
* Various IStreamSettings controls moved into IRequest.
* BayerTuple class replaces generic float[4] usage.
* BayerSharpnessMap::getBinData returns the entire sharpness map instead of
  requiring per-bin/per-channel calls.
* ICaptureSession::stopRepeat() returns the range of capture IDs that were
  submitted by the repeat[Burst]() call being stopped.

BUG FIXES:
* Gain ranges/values corrected.
* Many stability and multiprocess fixes.

KNOWN ISSUES:
* N/A

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
* Various debug information and all Argus API errors will be output by the
  nvargus-daemon service, which writes to syslog by default. The following may
  be used to monitor this logging:
    $ tail -f /var/log/syslog | grep argus
* If an application crash/hang occurs, the nvargus-daemon service may be left in
  a bad state, and the hardware may be unavailable for a short time afterwards.
  When this occurs it is best to restart the nvargus-daemon service and wait for
  about 15 seconds before attempting to run another application:
    sudo service nvargus-daemon restart

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release 0.95 (07/25/2016)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW FEATURES:
* Multi-process support. This adds an nvargus-daemon system service and
  corresponding client-side library that applications link against in order to
  enable multi-process support. Besides changing the Argus library being linked
  against, no other application changes are required for multi-process support.

  To link applications for multi-process use, replace the libnvargus.so library
  name with libnvargus_socketclient.so. Alternatively, if using the CMake build
  system with the sample applications, provide the optional MULTIPROCESS flag
  during the makefile generation step:
      'cmake -DMULTIPROCESS=ON ..'

  Multiprocess applications require the nvargus-daemon service to be running.
  This service runs automatically at boot time, though it remains uninitialized
  until the first multi-process Argus application is launched.  Once the
  service is initialized the daemon will lock the camera resources on the
  device and single-process Argus applications will fail to operate.
  The nvargus-daemon service can be controlled using the following:
      'sudo service nvargus-daemon [stop|start|restart]'
  Error logging from the daemon will be output to the syslog (/var/log/syslog)

* Feature-rich camera application sample with full GUI support.
  (Previously 'samples/camera', moved to 'apps/camera'.)

* New samples:
    gstVideoEncode - Encodes video through a GStreamer consumer.
    multiStream    - Uses two OutputStreams for simultaneous still captures and
                     preview from a single device.
    multiSensor    - Opens two devices for simultaneous still captures from one
                     device and preview from the other.
    oneShot        - "Bare minimum" Argus app; takes a single snapshot.
    syncSensor     - Computes the stereo disparity between two syncronized
                     sensors.

CHANGES:
* EGLStream creation is now handled directly by Argus during OutputStream
  creation instead of requring applications to first create an EGLStream before
  connecting Argus.

* Argus::EGLStream components (FrameConsumer, Frame, Image, etc.) moved out of
  Argus to become its own API. It continues to use Argus types, and includes
  functionality that interact directly with Argus (eg. Argus metadata support
  and FrameConsumer creation from an OutputStream), but is otherwise independent
  from Argus and can be used without an open CameraProvider. This API is still
  contained in libnvargus.so, but is expected to be moved to its own library in a
  future release.

BUG FIXES:
* Face detection and sample rendering orientation fixed.
* All sensor modes are exposed (previously limited to one mode).

KNOWN ISSUES:
* Histogram stats only returning first 64 of 256 bins.
* Instability with multi-sensor boards (eg. E3323).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release 0.91 (03/10/2016)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW FEATURES:
* Initial Argus release.

NOTES:
* As this is a beta release, the interfaces are not guaranteed to be
immutable; they may not be compatible with interfaces of the same name
from either previous or future releases.  Interface changes since the
last release are listed in the "CHANGES" section below.

* Current EGLStream Buffer Format Support:

    Format                     State
    =======================    ==========
    PIXEL_FMT_Y8               Not Supported
    PIXEL_FMT_Y16              Not Supported
    PIXEL_FMT_YCbCr_420_888    Works with all consumers.
    PIXEL_FMT_YCbCr_422_888    Not Supported
    PIXEL_FMT_YCbCr_444_888    Not Supported
    PIXEL_FMT_JPEG_BLOB        Not Supported (TODO: Remove format)
    PIXEL_FMT_RAW16            Not Supported

CHANGES:
* N/A

BUG FIXES:
* N/A

KNOWN ISSUES:
* The face detection algorithm is not detecting the device orientation
  correctly, and thus the input to the detection algorithm may be inverted
  with respect to the sensor. If face detection does not appear to be working,
  rotating the sensor 180 degrees may help.
